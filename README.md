## Design ethos

DEV Android is an [WebView](https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview) based application. This application is inspired by [Basecamp's approach](https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-3-for-ios-hybrid-architecture-afc071589c25). We will grow to include more native code over time. 

By leveraging webviews as much as possible, we can smoothly sync up with our web dev work. And where it makes sense, we can re-implement certain things fully native, or build entirely native features. Life's a journey, not a destination.
