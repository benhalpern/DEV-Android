# DEV Android

This is the repo for the [dev.to](/) Android app. There is nothing here, but with your help, maybe we can get this up and running soon! Thing should relate ideologically to the concepts we are building [with the iOS app](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/DEV-ios).

We are bought in to the Basecamp idea of building for native, described in a few articles and talks from them:

Our app doesn't have the exact same needs that they do, **_and we don't use Turbolinks in our web app_**, so we can't just copy their approach full-on, but I still think this jives for now. To be clear: I'm not sure whether we use Turbolinks native or not, but the part I do agree with is using web views and native nav etc. where possible to start, and thene evolving as is natural.

By leveraging web views as much as possible, I think we can make this all pretty awesome and sync up with our web dev work pretty smoothly. And where it makes sense, we can re-implement certain things fully native, or build entirely native features. Life's a journey, not a destination.
